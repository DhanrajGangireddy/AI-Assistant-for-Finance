# AI-Assistant-for-Finance

## Project Overview

The  Q&A Assistant is a chatbot application designed to provide concise and precise answers to user queries regarding the  financial website. The assistant leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, vector databases, and pre-trained language models to deliver accurate and relevant information to users. 

## Problem Statement

### Problem
Users often have various questions about financial products, services, and general information available on the Finsafe website. Manually searching for answers can be time-consuming and frustrating. There is a need for an efficient, automated system that can understand user queries and provide relevant information quickly.

### Challenges
1. Efficient Information Retrieval: Retrieving the most relevant information from a large corpus of text.
2. Accuracy of Responses: Ensuring the responses are accurate and helpful.
3. Handling Diverse Queries: Understanding and correctly interpreting a wide range of user queries.
4. Embedding Quality: Using the best embeddings to ensure high relevance in results.
5. Integration with Existing Systems: Seamlessly integrating the chatbot with the Finsafe website.

## Solution

### Approach
1. Data Collection:
   - Scrape and preprocess data from the  website to create a comprehensive knowledge base.
   - Remove unnecessary content such as disclaimers, login prompts, and CSS text.

2. Embeddings:
   - Use pre-trained language models (Hugging Face and OpenAI embeddings) to convert text data into vector embeddings.
   - Experiment with different embeddings to determine the most efficient model for accurate information retrieval.

3. Vector Database:
   - Utilize Chroma or Pinecone as the vector database to store and manage embeddings.
   - Ensure the database is optimized for quick retrieval of relevant information.

4. Chatbot Development:
   - Implement the chatbot using Langchain, Chroma, Hugging Face, and ChatGroq in a single script.
   - Develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setup to combine the power of embeddings with generative models.

5. Streamlit Interface:
   - Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface using Streamlit for users to interact with the chatbot.
   - Ensure the interface displays chat history, user input, and chatbot responses clearly.


## Conclusion

The Q&A Assistant aims to streamline user interactions with the Financial website by providing quick and accurate responses to queries. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques, embeddings, and vector databases, the assistant enhances user experience and ensures efficient information retrieval. Continuous evaluation and optimization will help maintain the chatbot's performance and relevance.
